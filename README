The Compete.com API Rails plugin provides you with a communication
class for interfacing directly with Compete.  It returns data in XML format and provides a parsing method that will return the latest Compete statistics for easy inclusion in your application.

=== Usage

@cp = Compete::Base.new( :compete_api_key => YOUR_COMPETE_API_KEY)
@compete_xml = @cp.do( :url => 'www.google.com')
p @cp.parse( @compete_xml )

# {:uv_ranking=>"1", :uv_count=>"135,834,459", :month=>"06", :domain=>"google.com", :year=>"2008", :rank=>"1"}
